# Docs for Pyrefly Development

These are design and planning docs for my own development flow - in particular
for agent-assisted development, which is often coordinated using markdown
files that I want to version control but not commit directly into the Pyrefly
codebase.

These are not user-facing docs, nor are they architecture docs intended to
have long lifetimes - they may prove useful for understanding architecture,
but they are each about a project and based on a snapshot in time; in addition
some projects will almost certainly not be implemented as described, or at all
(for example, I have multiple docs about different approaches to determinism
and at most one of them will be implemented on trunk).
